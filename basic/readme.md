# Directives

The **v-bind** attribute you are seeing is called a directive. **Directives** are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, it is basically saying “keep this element’s title attribute up-to-date with the message property on the Vue instance.”

**v-if**: if Statement

**v-for**: for loop

**v-on** directive to attach event listeners that invoke methods on our Vue instances

**v-model**: directive that makes two-way binding between form input and app state

# Components

The component system is another important concept in Vue, because it’s an abstraction that allows us to build large-scale applications composed of small, self-contained, and often reusable components. If we think about it, almost any type of application interface can be abstracted into a tree of components
