# Learning Vue

Hi, this is my first steps to learn vuejs,

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Unlike other monolithic frameworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate with other libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with modern tooling and supporting libraries.

## Lifecycle Hooks

Each component instance goes through a series of initialization steps when it's created - for example, it needs to set up data observation, compile the template, mount the instance to the DOM, and update the DOM when data changes. Along the way, it also runs functions called lifecycle hooks, giving users the opportunity to add their own code at specific stages.

```javascript
Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return { count: 1 };
  },
  created() {
    // `this` points to the vm instance
    console.log("count is: " + this.count); // => "count is: 1"
  },
});
```
